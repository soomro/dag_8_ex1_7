        In this exercise we want to create a class that hold a sale transaction that an employee makes with a client. The sales class should contain a name of the product sold, the money sold for in dollars (double), and a client class that references a client. Also, create a DateTime property that hold the information about when the sale was made. Let the employee class hold a collection of sales objects and implement a method that adds a new sales to the list. Also, create a constructor that instantiates the sales object. The date of the sale can be created in the constructor as the current date (DateTime.Now).
